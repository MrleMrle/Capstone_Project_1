            In my free time, I enjoy running and recently completed the GRAWE half marathon. Not to brag, but I finished 58th, which is quite the achievement considering the number of ice cream scoops I've sold in my life. So, if you need someone to represent your company, who can outrun at least 57 other people, I'm your guy.<br><br>
            Recently, I've embarked on a new adventure - gym workouts. I'm still a newbie, but I'm committed and ready to flex my muscles. I also spend time on the tennis courts with a friend, where we're on a seemingly endless quest to perfect our forehand strokes. So far, we're serving more laughs than aces, but we're getting there, one swing at a time.<br>
            And last but not least, I occasionally indulge in a game of Dota or CSGO. But don't worry, I always remind myself of the famous gaming quote, 'It's just a game, why do you have to be mad?' So even though I might not be the top player, I'm definitely the most chill
