        <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>My name is Marijan Matić, I am 30 years old, and I am currently studying at the Faculty of Organization and
            Informatics. Prior to this, I held various jobs, from door-to-door sales for Bofrost, to working in call centers for
            companies like A1 and HT. After my last job at A1, where I worked in technical support, I developed a curiosity
            for that area of the industry and decided to study at FOI.<br>
            In addition to my studies, I'm on the lookout for work in the industry. I  want to start building real-world skills
            now, because I know that what  you learn on the job is just as important as what you learn in class.  I'm ready to
            dive into any role that lets me put what I've learned into  action and start gathering hands-on experience.
